# Contributing to GrafanaCommander

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Verifone Commander Monitoring Stack! This guide will help you get started.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Basic understanding of Python, Prometheus, and Grafana

### Setup for Development
1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Copy configuration templates:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp credentials.yaml.example credentials.yaml
   cp commanders.csv.example commanders.csv
   ```
3. Update configuration files with your test environment details
4. Start the development stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow existing Python conventions in the codebase
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for complex functions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Testing
- Test changes with representative Commander loads
- Verify dashboards work correctly after modifications
- Ensure all services start properly with `docker-compose up`

### Configuration Changes
- Always provide example files for new configuration options
- Update documentation when adding new features
- Ensure backward compatibility when possible

## üîß Areas for Contribution
