# Primary polling interval - Controls how often the Python app queries POS systems
# IMPORTANT: When you change this, also update prometheus.yml scrape_interval to (this_value + 30 seconds)
# Example: 6 minutes here → 6m30s in prometheus.yml to avoid scraping stale data
# Common values: 5, 6, or 10 minutes
scrape_interval_minutes: 6

# Network timeout for POS system API calls
# Increase if you have slow network connections or distant POS systems
timeout_seconds: 30

# Configuration Examples for Different Deployment Scenarios:
#
# Fast Polling (High Network Capacity):
# scrape_interval_minutes: 5
# → Update prometheus.yml to: scrape_interval: 5m30s
#
# Standard Polling (Most Deployments):
# scrape_interval_minutes: 6
# → Update prometheus.yml to: scrape_interval: 6m30s
#
# Conservative Polling (Limited Network/High Latency):
# scrape_interval_minutes: 10
# → Update prometheus.yml to: scrape_interval: 10m30s
#
# Remember to restart both services after making changes:
# docker-compose restart posproctor-app prometheus
